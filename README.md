# TTNIC
•	The goal of this assessed homework was to practice the use of the ggplot2 library
•	Manipulated the data using dplyr, tidyverse, and lubridate libraries to put it in the analysis-ready format
•	Produced a ggplot bar graph, one bar showing the number of survivors and the other the number of casualties
•	Reported what fraction of passengers survived or perished using a proportion table
•	Produced a bar graph of survivors by sex, where the bar segments (in different colors) represent who survived and who did not, but using one facet par passenger class
